# Data_Visualization_project
Data Visualization project part of Data Visualization course at Aarhus University, Fall 2019 semester. 

## Should you expand your portfolio with Sneakers? 
In this project a dataset from a sneaker reselling website (https://stockx.com) will be explored. The visualizations are build with the purpose of informing users about underlying insights in the dataset. This
is done by defining a task abstraction and evaluating each visualization by its expressiveness and effectiveness. The overall goal is to inform the user about trends, so that the user can define its own trading strategy. 
A heatmap visualization is used to give an overview of the data, and details on demand are presented by using a scatter plot with technical indicators.
